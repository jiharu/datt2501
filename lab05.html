## Review
- Project 1
- Tumblr

## Skinning
Joints are given an influence over the vertices near to them. As a joint rotates, it deforms the vertices it has influence over. The process of defining which vertices are manipulated by which joints is called skinning.

## Rigging
Creating the joints themselves and building handles to manipulate those joints is referred to as rigging.

# Basic skinning
Let's prepare a simple cylindrical mesh and simple joint chains to practice, and do experiments in order to get to know the basics of skinning.
  
## Cylinder skinning
- Let's change the subdivision values and look at how different it looks when you apply Bind skin.  
- Let's change the max influence value to emulate 'rigid' skin or 'smooth' skin.

![rg](img/maya/skinning/rigid.png)   
Bind Skin: rigid binding emulation. Max influences: 1, Second joint rotate Z: 45. 

### Editing skin weight

- Select the body surface and choose *Paint Skin Weights*. It employs the Artisan brush interface to set weights interactively.
	- [Common Artisan Brush Tool Settings](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/Maya/files/GUID-67B8F095-4A0E-4BAE-938C-CB41B3EBD533-htm.html)
  
- Use *Component Edito*r: It gives you precise control over each vertex and the exact amount of weight it receives.

-------------------------------------

## Visor
Let's move to a hand model to practice further. You can collect a model to which you would like to add a skeleton from the Visor (Windows > General editors > Visor).

![visor](img/maya/skinning/visor.png) 
I selected a horse and wing and combined them, adjusting transformations, and then deleting history & combining to make into a single mesh. I also assigned a blinn material to change the color.

We can start with a simpler model, such as an alien hand from the Bipens folder in the Visor.

- Prepare the model with a proper position and size.
- Create joint chains and don't forget to properly name the joints. 
- Check out whether its local axis is aligned well.  
- Delete history from the mesh first, then:
- Bind skin
- Let's practice with the 'paint skin weight' to control skinning.
- Test while doing animation. 
- Repeat the processes -- you can learn by trial and error while trying to understand the concepts.

Once you feel comfortable doing skinning, let's move to a more complex character.

![an](img/maya/skinning/alien.png) ![lego](img/maya/skinning/lego.png)  

You can find the alien body from the Visor.   
<!--You can download the lego model from here: [legomodel.obj](data/legomodel.obj)-->

Here, we can work on more elaborate options from the Skeleton and Skin commands, such as 'Mirror joints', 'Orient joints', and 'Unbind skin', 'Go to Bind pose' and so on.

![menu](img/maya/skinning/menu.png)

Let's open the **component editor** to control skinning.

## Tutorial reference
- [Painting Weights and Skinning: A Straighforward Approach by Kiel Figgins](http://www.3dfiggins.com/writeups/paintingWeights/) - This document covers: the importance of joint placement, creating a low resolution mesh to weight, transferring those weights back to the high-res mesh, additional time saving tools for weighting and mirroring weights, and other useful tips and information. 

- [ABOUT MAYA JOINT ORIENT by Rigging Dojo](http://www.riggingdojo.com/2014/10/03/everything-thought-knew-maya-joint-orient-wrong/)

----------------
## Mixamo
Mixamo develops and sells web-based services for 3D character animation. Mixamo's technologies use machine learning methods to automate the steps of the character animation process, including 3D modeling to rigging and 3D animation.

This is where you can find an automated, finished character & animation:
