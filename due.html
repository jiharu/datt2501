# Assignment 1
## Due date: Sun Jan 15th midnight. 
### Subject: Inspiration 

- **Inspiration:** research 3D animation works (online or offline) and **select a motion of around 10 seconds which you want to recreate. You can upload the still images of captures or your own drawings to the class Tumblr portfolio**, along with a link to the video and any article about it with proper credits and reference. Please specify the time in seconds of the selected part, with one or two sentences to explain why you chose it.
	- When you upload please write down "a01 (assignment 01) by your school ID, name" - This is important for the sake of grading later.
	
- **Reading:** ['PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL ANIMATION APPLIED TO 3D COMPUTER ANIMATION'](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~fussell/courses/cs384g-fall2006/projects/animator/lasseter.pdf) by John Lasseter from Pixar, written in 1987. 	

>ABSTRACT  
>This paper describes the basic principles of traditional 2D hand drawn
animation and their application to 3D computer animation. After describing
how these principles evolved, the individual principles are detailed,
addressing their meanings in 2D hand drawn animation and their application
to 3D computer animation. This should demonstrate the importance of
these principles to quality 3D computer animation.

# Assignment 2
## Due date: Sun Jan 22nd midnight.  
### Subject: Planning/Analysis

- Complete to prepare the scene with a ball hierarchy structure and bring it next week.

	- What to include:
		- Path of action: draw good and proper spline **arcs**.

# Assignment 5

## Announcement: Project 2 will be combined to project 3! 
### Due date: Sun Feb 12 midnight.  
### Subject: Skinning basics and overall review

- Choose a 3D model to carry skinning. A proper skinning process is very time consuming and difficult. Expect repeated trial and error to master it. 

- What is important is your understanding and problem solving techniques along with your creative expression. For learning 3D, fluency accumulates over time. Therefore, if you are not sure about any parts, steps, terms, or concepts, please do thorough reviews of our previous lecture materials and work more for any further necessary research. 

- **Make a short animation showing your skinning result and upload to Tumblr**. This time, the length, details will all be your choice. Please use this as your research-practice opportunity since we need to build good fundamentals to make strong animation later. 

- Write *what was the most difficult part to achieve* in your short description.

------------------
# Assignment 6

### Due date: Sun Mar 4 midnight.  
### Subject: Rigging basics

- **Make your choices of two short animations from the week 8 lab practices, to show your rigging-related practices, and upload them to Tumblr**.
- Practice making your own character rigging, keeping good focus on analysis and planning.

------------------
# Assignment 7

### Due date: Sun Mar 11 midnight. 
### Subject: Character rigging

#### Work on your character rigging up to the point we reached in the lab - applying the lower body rigging to both legs and foot.

1. Write down your comments (test results) about a fellow student's character rigging, and upload them to Tumblr. (If you can't find one, you can write down comments about your own rigging).
	- Please research good rigged examples or tutorials to get a firm understanding. Moreover analyze the targeted motion to modify joints in the next lab.
	
2. Solve problems to make your character rigging ready to animate for a walking cycle animation by next class.

# Project 2 (30%)
## Due date: Fri Mar 23 midnight. 
### Subject: Walking human
### Where to submit: Moodle (a folder) and Tumblr (your animation or a link to your animation)

- **Walking human**: Walking animation with a rigged character 

With your definition of certain characteristics of walking, expressing how a person's body language can reflect mood, emotions, and even personality, create your 10 seconds long (300 frames) walking human with your rigged character. You can either make one walk cycle and repeat it, or alternate it. Submit to Moodle as follows:

- Please collect your final work and related files into one folder:
	1. The name of folder: ```"surname_name"``` (e.g., ```ji_haru```, ```shaik_yifat```)  
	2. What to include in the folder: 
		1. Your Playblast hardware rendered animation: 640 * 480 pixels size, saved as mov or avi. 
		2. Your Maya file (.mb or .ma file) 
		3. One page documentation as a PDF file, describing the story (characteristic), processes, and challenge of your walking animation. 
		4. Where to submit: Moodle  
				
- Please upload your animation to Tumblr too.
- (Option 1) You can use your own character which you created, or the rigged character which you can download from the class website (week 10).	
- (Option 2) You can add music it it helps.

_____________________________
### Criteria of evaluation
1. Good analysis and expression in the walking animation: with the twelve traditional principles of animation. 
2. Care on details in the processes of building a skeleton and rigging including naming, cleaning such as locking or hiding unnecessary attributes and deleting unnecessary histories.  
3. Aesthetically or creatively pleasing actions.  		

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project 3 (30%)
## Due date: Fri Apr 13 midnight. 
### Subject: Free theme.
### Where to submit: Moodle (a folder) and Tumblr (your animation or a link to your animation)

Create your  batch rendered animation, of around 15 seconds long (300 to 600 frames), with a theme of your choosing. Consider the time limitations for working on the animation pipeline as well as the batch rendering speed. Be careful not to be too ambitious without first rendering tests. Creating animation can be a very complex, difficult, and sometimes tedious, but the final result can be very fun and rewarding. Please decide your focus. If your animation idea is complex and very long, make only a short part of it. 

Submit to Moodle as follows:

- Please collect your final work and related files into one folder:
	1. The name of folder: ```"surname_name"``` (e.g., ```ji_haru```, ```shaik_yifat```)  
	2. What to include in the folder: 
		1. Your **Batch Rendered** animation: 640 * 480 pixels size, saved as mov or avi - first, batch reder as an image sequence and later saved as mov or avi using FCheck.   
		2. Your Maya file (.mb or .ma file) 
		3. One page documentation as a PDF file, describing your theme, processes, references, challenges, and foci of your animation. 
		4. Your storyboard (scanned or photographed)
		5. Where to submit: Moodle  
				
- Please upload your animation to Tumblr too.

- (Option 1) You can add music it it helps.
- (Option 2) You can make a team consisted with 2 - 3 students from the class. In this case, please specify the role of each clearly in the project statement.

### Criteria of evaluation

1. Quality of expression: unique or artistic or both.  
2. Technical understanding.  	
3. Good control on workflow and animation pipeline.
