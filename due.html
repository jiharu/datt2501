<!--# 3D Modeling and Texturing --> 

# Assignment 1
## Due date: Sun Jan 15th midnight. 
### Subject: Inspiration 

- **Inspiration:** research 3D animation works (online or offline) and **select a motion of around 10 seconds which you want to recreate. You can upload the still images of captures or your own drawings to the class Tumblr portfolio**, along with a link to the video and any article about it with proper credits and reference. Please specify the time in seconds of the selected part, with one or two sentences to explain why you chose it.
	- When you upload please write down "a01 (assignment 01) by your school ID, name" - This is important for the sake of grading later.
	
- **Reading:** ['PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL ANIMATION APPLIED TO 3D COMPUTER ANIMATION'](data/lasseter.pdf) by John Lasseter from Pixar, written in 1987. 	

>ABSTRACT  
>This paper describes the basic principles of traditional 2D hand drawn
animation and their application to 3D computer animation. After describing
how these principles evolved, the individual principles are detailed,
addressing their meanings in 2D hand drawn animation and their application
to 3D computer animation. This should demonstrate the importance of
these principles to quality 3D computer animation.

# Assignment 2
## Due date: Sun Jan 22nd midnight.  
### Subject: Planning/Analysis

- Complete to prepare the scene with a ball hierarchy structure and bring it next week.

- Make **original sketches (1 to 3 pages)** based on your analyses and research to animate a bouncing ball, and upload them to Tumblr by scanning or taking photos.   
	- What to include:
		- Path of action: draw good and proper spline **arcs**.
		- Plan how you will cut your timing: draw tick marks to show slow in and slow out **spacing**.
		- Key drawings: draw extreme and inbetween shapes with a number of key frames. You can apply **squash and stretch** showing the ball's weight & speed and its friction with the ground.   
		- Definition of characteristics of a ball: its weight, softness, size, and so on.  
- If you have a story, please make a simple storyboard and upload it to the Tumblr too.	  
- When you upload please write down "a02 (assignment 02) by your school ID, name"

# Assignment 3

## Due date: Mon Feb 6 midnight (11:59 pm).  
### Subject: Maya kinematics & wave animation

- Make two short animations, each around 150 frames and upload to Tumblr. One is applying Maya kinematics and principles of animation: follow through, and the other is creating a wave animation using the Dope sheet editor. ***If the size of file is too big, upload it to Vimeo or Youtube and upload the link to Tumblr.***

	- **IK & FK chain:** there must be at least one IK and one FK chain (one or more).
	- **Story or emotion:** you can set up a simple interaction scene to describe an event as a story: for example, the hand you made tried to pick up a glass or an apple. Wave motion can be from an animal's tail or a pendulum.    
	- **Principles of animation:** try to express 'anticipation', 'slow in and slow out', and more importantly, 'follow through / overlapping action'.
	- Support it with a short description and write down "a03 (assignment 03) by your school ID, name" 

_____________________________
	
# Assignment 4

## Due date: Mon Feb 13 midnight (11:59 pm).  
### Subject: Skinning basics and overall review

- Choose a 3D model for skinning. A proper skinning process can be very time consuming and difficult. Expect repeated trial and error to master it.   
- **Make a short animation showing your skinning result and upload to Tumblr**. This time, the length, details will all be your choice. Please use this as your research-practice opportunity since we need to build good fundamentals to make strong animations later.   
- Write *what was the most difficult part to achieve* in your short description.  
- Please add "a04 by your school ID, name"  

	- What is important is your understanding and problem solving techniques along with your creative expression. For learning 3D, fluency accumulates over time. Therefore, if you are not sure about any parts, steps, terms, or concepts, please do thorough reviews of our previous lecture materials and work more for any further necessary research.

# Project 3 (30%)
## Due date: Fri Apr 14 midnight (11:59 pm).
### Subject: Free theme.
### Where to submit: 
- Google (as a folder) and Tumblr (your animation or a link to your animation). The link will be closed on the due date, but a different link will be offered for late submissions (including late assignments), until Apr 16th (midnight).
- [Lab01 submission link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LdFZhYkk3dzNkSm8?usp=sharing)  
- [Lab02 submission link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LTkF0WTVWVEpzQjA?usp=sharing)  
- [Lab03 submission link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LdUtFMzVTNGk1SEU?usp=sharing)

Create your  batch rendered animation, of around 10 to 20 seconds long (300 to 600 frames), with a theme of your choosing. Consider the time limitations for working on the animation pipeline as well as the batch rendering speed. Be careful not to be too ambitious without first rendering tests. Creating animation can be a very complex, difficult, and sometimes tedious, but the final result can be very fun and rewarding. Please decide your focus. If your animation idea is complex and very long, make only a short part of it. 

Submit to Moodle as follows:

- Please collect your final work and related files into one folder:
	1. The name of folder and files: ```"surname_name"``` (e.g., ```ji_haru```, ```hambleton_joe```)  
	2. What to include in the folder: 
		1. Your **Batch Rendered** animation: 640 * 480 pixels size, saved as mov or avi - first, batch reder as an image sequence and later saved as mov or avi using FCheck.   
		2. Your project folder including your **final** Maya file with only **used** other files.   
		3. One page documentation as a PDF file, describing your theme, processes, references, challenges, and foci of your animation.  
			- Don’t forget if you you use any borrowed modeling/texturing or animation data, include proper references and links.
			- The description should include your goal, process, challenges, and achievement. They don’t need to be long but try to record facts which can help you in the future and communicate with me well.  
		4. Your storyboard (scanned or photographed)  
				
- Please upload your animation to Tumblr too.

- (Option 1) You can add music it it helps.
- (Option 2) You can use a found modeling and animation data. In this case, please specify the reference.
