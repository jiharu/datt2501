## HIK: Skeleton generator
Reference: Mastering Autodesk Maya 2016: Autodesk Official Press. 
 
- Start with a new scene in Maya. From the Rigging menu set, choose Skeleton / HumanIK. The Character Controls panel opens.

- Choose Create / Skeleton from the Character Controls button or from the first section of the Character Controls panel. A large biped skeleton is created in the viewport, and the Character Controls panel is refreshed with a new set of options.

- Import your modeling data. [Download Pepe modeling data here](data/pepe.obj)
	- You can Mesh / Seperate to add shaders to Pepe's body parts. 
	- After assigning shaders, you can shift select body parts and Mesh / Combine.
	- Now, you need to delete history so that you can have a clean one body object to move to the next level.

- In the Skeleton tab of the Character Controls panel, check Lower–Arms to add roll bones to the character’s forearms.

- You can customize the existing skeleton further by adding or taking away toes, spine joints, and numerous other bones. You can also modify the bones directly to fit your character by translating and rotating the bones in the viewport.
	- You can delete left or right joint to work on one part and later do **mirror** using the HIK editor.

- Once it is done, **lock your skeleton** from the menu icon.

## Skeleton definition

- After the skeleton is made, it must be characterized by the HIK system; characterizing a skeleton means mapping each joint to a corresponding joint within the HIK system. Once that’s done, the HIK solver can understand your skeleton and you can apply a control rig. *Since you used the built-in Skeleton Generator, you do not need to map the bones.*


## HIK: Character controls
- With any bone selected, click the Character Controls menu button and choose Create / Control Rig. This automatically locks the skeleton from further changes. The Character Controls panel is updated again and a Control Rig is added to the skeleton.

- You can select different style of control effectors.

## Skinning

- Select **the highest joint of the skeleton** and the mesh and apply Bind Skin.

## Skin weights controls

- First, let's hide FK from the control menu, then choose the mesh and apply Paint skin weights. 
- Make some poses by moving IK handles until you find the errors and adjust using the Paint skin weights tool.

## Character controls


, and open its Attribute Editor.
In the Attribute Editor, choose the HIKproperties1 tab. Open the Roll & Pitch rollout.
Set the Left Forearm Roll to 0.5. With a 0.5 value, the left forearm joint will rotate approximately half the amount of the left wrist effector’s rotation.
Set the Left Elbow Roll to 0.2. With a 0.2 value, the elbow joint will rotate approximately 20 percent of the left wrist effector’s rotation. This will also cause the left forearm to rotate 20 percent less than what was stated in step 3.
Rotate the left wrist effector in the x-axis. Select each joint along the forearm to see how the roll attributes affected their values.
At any time, you can return your character or parts of your character to their stance pose by clicking the Character Control menu button and choosing Edit / Controls / Stance Pose. The selection mode, set in the Character Controls panel, dictates whether the full body is returned to the stance pose or whether only the selected body parts are returned.
